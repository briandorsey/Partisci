.. WARNING::
   This project is using readme driven development and has not been implemented yet.

Where is your software installed?  Is version X still in use anywhere?

Partisci answers these questions by collecting updates from your programs and providing a REST API to access the data.

Partisci can answer these questions:
 * What hosts is application X installed on?
 * Which versions of application X are active?
 * Is version Y of application X still active anywhere?
 * Which hosts are runinng version Y of application X?
 * When did application X last update? (from host Z?)
 * What applications are installed on host Z?

However, Partisci *only* knows about applications which have been modified to send it updates.
